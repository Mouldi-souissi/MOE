			<p className='block_4'>
				At VISIOCONF we strive to create quality software that you enjoy using
				for your business or professional life. You have a number of choices and
				we appreciate you giving us your business. Thank You. We have created
				this policy that details what we will do should we fail to meet your
				expectations.
			</p>
			<p className='block_4'>
				<b className='calibre1'>Monthly or Annual Subscriptions.</b> If at
				anytime during your<b className='calibre1'> first 30 days</b> of using
				our service you are dissatisfied, please contact us. We will do our best
				to address your issue, provide a work around or give a timeline for a
				solution that will meet your needs. If you are not satisfied, we will
				gladly offer you a <b className='calibre1'>FULL REFUND</b> for your
				purchase, and close your account.
			</p>
			<p className='block_4'>
				We want you to be happy with our service throughout your entire
				contract, not only the first 30 days. So we go beyond that. If at
				anytime during your contract we remove, break or discontinue
				functionality that was available at the time you signed up for your
				contract, we ask you to notify us immediately. If we fail to address it
				on a timely manner to your entire satisfaction, we will offer you a{" "}
				<b className='calibre1'>PRO-RATED REFUND</b> for the remainder of your
				contract.
			</p>
			<p className='block_4'>
				<b className='calibre1'>Auto-Renewal.</b> For your convenience, your
				monthly and yearly subscriptions will auto-renew until you cancel the
				service. Every time before your subscription auto-renews, we will send a
				mail specifying the amount that will be charged to your credit card.
				Similarly, after each renewal we will send you a receipt via e-mail
				specifying the amount that has been deducted together with the next
				renewal date and the next renewal amount.
			</p>
			<p className='block_4'>
				We know that sometimes customers forget to cancel an account they no
				longer want until it is has already been charged. That’s why you can
				cancel your monthly/annual subscription{" "}
				<b className='calibre1'>
					even five business days after your renewal date,
				</b>{" "}
				and we will still process your cancellation and give you a{" "}
				<b className='calibre1'>FULL REFUND</b>.
